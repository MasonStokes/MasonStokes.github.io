## Homework 2

1.For this assignment I created a new branch called homework 2. I used both the index.html
and stylesheet.css files from assignment 1 to save time.

2.In the design process of this assignment I started out with thinking about what is required,
I needed to create an html form and thne take what is input into the form while using javascript's library jquery to return something within the same webpage.

My project takes a 9 digit integer and returns a random number of results. I first needed to figure out how to create a random number generator using javascript. This would allow me to
generate a result for the form, I then had to figure out how to use js to write the html code
generate a view of the result.

3.A sketch of the page before input of data and the result after submitting the form.
