    <h1>Homework 3 Blog</h1>

    <p>
        I began this homework by creating a new project in visual studio, after doing that
        I wrote each file the the order indicated on the assignment list. I began by
        writing as much of the code that I could simply translate from java to c# without
        having to look it up, this was easy because of the syntax similarities between the 
        two languages.

    <p>
        It is easy to see that the node file is almost, if not, identical in c# to java.

        <img src="./images/node.png" alt="" class="img-thumbnail">
    </div>

    <p>
        When creating the QueueUnderflowException file there weren't many changes to make,
        c# uses ':' instead of extends and does not use a super() function.
    </p>

    </div>

    <p>
        Creating a LinkedQueue in C# is almost exactly the same as java.
